# What is LAMP Stack?

LAMP Stack is a strong web stack that has been around for quite a long time. It is relatively simple to employ because all four technologies, L (Linux), A (Apache), M (MariaDB), and P (PHP), work together well and complement one another nicely. Each of these elements falls under the FOSS category, which stands for Free Open Source Software.

## so now what is a Web stack?

" A web stack is a solution stack or software stack, is a group of software that functions cohesively for web development."

Web stacks are convenient because dynamic websites can run on them without requiring anything else. All the pieces of a web stack come together to form a platform ideal for web development. For example, some highly complex applications beneficial such as WordPress run on top of LAMP Stack. LAMP Stack and other stacks like it are when creating dynamic websites and large web applications.


### Installation Steps for LAMP
### Step 1

First thing we're going to do here is we're going to update our pachages in Ubuntu, that is what we are working on and we're going to say sudo apt-get update keep putting your password and we're just going to update everything, once is done we're going to install Apache okay so we'll say sudo apt-get install apache2 ok we're going to say yes.


```js
// Linux commands used on this step
sudo apt-get update 
sudo apt-get install apache2 
}
```

```ruby
# Ruby code with syntax highlighting
GitHubPages::Dependencies.gems.each do |gem, version|
  s.add_dependency(gem, "= #{version}")
end
```

### There's a horizontal rule below this.

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item

### Definition lists can be used with HTML syntax.

<dl>
<dt>Name</dt>
<dd>Godzilla</dd>
<dt>Born</dt>
<dd>1952</dd>
<dt>Birthplace</dt>
<dd>Japan</dd>
<dt>Color</dt>
<dd>Green</dd>
</dl>

```
Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
```

```
The final element.
